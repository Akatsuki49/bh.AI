## Inspiration

The project bh.AI is based upon a recent study that made headlines:

*"20 percent of single American men confessed they had zero close friends. More than half of all men report feeling unsatisfied with the size of their friend groups."*

## Introduction

bh.AI is an emotional companion app designed to address the issue of loneliness and lack of emotional support. It aims to provide users with a platform to express their feelings and emotions freely. Users can log in to the app and engage in conversations with bh.AI about their emotional state.

## How It Works!


bh.AI is built using Flutter for the frontend, Flask for the backend, Mistral AI for querying, and Firebase for authentication. Here's how it works:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users can sign up or log in using their email and password via Firebase authentication.

2. **Chat Functionality:**
   - Upon logging in, users are presented with a chat screen where they can communicate with bh.AI about how they are feeling.
   - Users can send text messages to bh.AI, expressing their emotions and feelings.

3. **Emotion Analysis using Deepface:**
   - When a user sends a message, a photo is captured of their face using the device's camera.
   - The photo is then sent as a byte stream to the backend Flask server, where a deep learning model (deepface) performs emotion analysis on the face.
   - The emotion analysis results, combined with the user's chat input, are used to formulate a query to Mistral AI, a personalized prompt engineering platform, to generate a comforting response.

4. **Storage and Personalization:**
   - The app stores the user's chat history to provide personalized responses in the future.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Flutter - An open source cross platform UI framework, using which the beautiful screens of bh.AI were built
- **Backend:** Flask - Backend for the app, uses python , does the image processing as well as queries the LLM using the prompt we engineered  
- **AI Querying:** Mistral AI - An open source and a secure LLM used in the project. 
- **Authentication:** Firebase - Backend as a Service software used to manager user authentication.
